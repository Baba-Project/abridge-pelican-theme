# Abridge Pelican Theme

This is the "Abridge" theme for Pelican, an old project of mine. Please note that some features within this theme are incomplete or may not function as expected. It has been uploaded primarily as an example for developers who wish to explore and continue its development.

This theme is an adaptation for Pelican of the original "Abridge" Zola theme.
